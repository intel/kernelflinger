Files in this directory is used to build fastboot elf without Android
build environment.

The build out "fastboot" is positioned as basic flash tool only. Thus,
limited fastboot commands are supported:

fastboot flash <partition> <filename>  //flash gpt or flash some data to
a disk partition or some special data.
fastboot erase <partition>  //erase a partition.
fastboot gatvar <var_name>|all  //get a var value or all vars value.
fastboot reboot  //Reboot the device.
fastboot reboot-bootloader  //Reboot the device to fastboot mode.

Tested on ubuntu 16.04, cmake3.5 and clang6.0 or above are needed.
for ubuntu 14.04, cmake3 and clang3.9 should be installed by apt-get.

To compile fastboot.elf standalone, in your workdir
	cmake path-to-kernelflinger/build
dependent sources will be cloned by git automatically, then
	cmake --build .

The default target platform is broxton, optional target platform is
broxton, icelake, tigerlake, kabylake, to set target platform, set variable
TARGET_BOARD_PLATFORM in config.cmake

The generated fastboot.sym.elf in workdir is an elf executable with system symbols,
no ui, and doesn't support x86_64 for the time being.
